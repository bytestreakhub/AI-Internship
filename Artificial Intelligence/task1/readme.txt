Title: How to Perform Sentiment Analysis using Python


Introduction:
Sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique, is crucial in identifying the polarity of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. 
This technique finds applications in analyzing customer feedback, social media posts, product reviews, and more. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to build a sentiment analysis model using Python, 
leveraging the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library and TextBlob.

Tutorial Overview:

Install and Import Libraries: Begin by installing and importing the necessary libraries, including NLTK and TextBlob.
Define Sample Texts: Define sample texts that we want to analyze. In this tutorial, we'll use tweets about Verizon Support.
Perform Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob: Utilize TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on each tweet. TextBlob's sentiment attribute provides polarity and subjectivity scores.
Perform Sentiment Analysis using NLTK: Another approach to sentiment analysis is using NLTK's built-in sentiment analyzer, VADER. VADER provides granular information about negative, neutral, and positive sentiments, along with compound scores.
Conclusion: Summarize the tutorial, highlighting the importance and versatility of sentiment analysis and its applications in various domains.
Conclusion:
Sentiment analysis is a powerful technique with broad applications. By leveraging libraries like NLTK and TextBlob, analysts and developers can gain insights from text data, enabling better decision-making and understanding of user sentiment.
