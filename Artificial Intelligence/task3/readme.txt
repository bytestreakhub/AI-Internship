Overview
This project is a simple chatbot application that can interact with users to answer questions using both Google Search and Wikipedia. It uses the Google Custom Search API to fetch search results and the Wikipedia API to fetch summaries of topics. Additionally, the chatbot has a response mechanism for general conversation.

Features
Google Search Integration: Fetches top links for a given search query using the Google Custom Search API.
Wikipedia Integration: Provides summaries of topics from Wikipedia.
Basic Chatbot Responses: Responds to general questions and farewells.
Setup and Installation
