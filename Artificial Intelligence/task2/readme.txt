Keyword Generator for SEO
A keyword generator is a tool that uses algorithms to generate relevant keywords for a given topic or search query.
It uses natural language processing to suggest keywords based on user input, analyze search trends, and generate keyword variations. 

To create a keyword generator for SEO using AI technologies, you need to use natural language processing algorithms to generate relevant keywords from user input.
You will also need to use machine learning algorithms to identify the most relevant keywords and optimize the content. 
For this project, you also need to use deep learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the results.
